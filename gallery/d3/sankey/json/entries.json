This relationship\r\nwas expected because plankton blooms depend on warm ocean\r\ntemperatures. Although other variables, such as nutrient load\r\nassociated with run-off, mixing, upwelling, light availability, etc.,\r\nmay be related to plankton blooms, the relationship between\r\nSST and V. cholerae is more direct. Furthermore, it is now known\r\nthat plankton serve as a reservoir for V. cholerae (2). The delay\r\nbetween the time of SST increase until cholera cases increase can\r\nbe accounted for by the hypothesized response of phytoplankton\r\nto increased temperature and subsequent zooplankton bloom,\r\nthe latter closely approximating the increase in cholera. Interestingly,\r\nin 1993, an association was not observed. Although the\r\nSSTs were within the normal range for that year, spring SSHs\r\nwere the lowest observed for the entire period, 1992\u20131995. In\r\nOctober, 1993, the SSHs were above those expected, and the next\r\nmonth, a cholera outbreak occurred. Bangladesh is at, or only\r\nslightly above, sea level, with tidal influences as far inland as\r\nDhaka (Fig. 1), providing an explanation for the observed\r\npattern. The SSH and cholera data relationships for 1993 suggest\r\nthe extent of tidal intrusion of plankton into inland waters\r\ninfluences the Vibrio-human contact, as water is consumed from\r\nthe river system, without treatment, and used for daily hygiene,\r\ne.g., washing etc., by a majority of residents in Bangladesh. As\r\nnoted, SSHs were anomalously low, indicating little or no inland\r\nintrusion of plankton. In October, when the SSHs returned to\r\nnormal, an outbreak of cholera occurred shortly thereafter.","draft":"0","cc":"Ocean climate change","pg":"1\u2502Bacteria","ps":"Cholera","pa":"Vibrio cholerae","ttg":"2\u2502Water-borne","tts":"Drinking water","ttss":null,"ttsa":"Contact","ttsas":null,"user":"Erik Franklin","PDF":"Lobitz_etal_PNAS_2000.pdf","authors":"B.

Differences in precipitation were significantly associated with the occurrence of anthrax outbreaks (\u03c72 = 4.75, p < 0.03), indicating that the likelihood of outbreaks occurring was higher during the dry months when human occupancy of the floodplain was greater compared to the flooding months when people and livestock moved out of this region. Human dependency on the floodplain was shown to significantly influence the epidemiology of anthrax in the upper Zambezi floodplain of western Zambia.

A baseline survey in three villages of Satkhira found that 61 percent of households used pond water for drinking and 81 percent used it for household purposes in the dry season. There are concerns over the potential effects of salinity in drinking water and nutritional intake of the coastal populations affected, especially on maternal and child health. To date, few surveys on the potential effects of water salinity have been conducted. Salinity in groundwater was found to increase the burden of diarrheal diseases in coastal populations.

Japanese encephalitis was first\r\nrecognised in Tamil Nadu in 1955 on the basis of\r\nserological surveys. Subsequent surveys carried out by the\r\nNational Institute of Virology in Pune have indicated that\r\nabout half the population in South India has neutralising\r\nantibodies to the virus. In the last decade, there has been a\r\nmajor upsurge of Japanese encephalitis in many states,\r\nnamely, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Karnataka,\r\nManipur, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,\r\nUttar Pradesh, Pondicherry and West Bengal (54). Japanese\r\nencephalitis is currently endemic in 135 districts in\r\n15 states and union territories of India. A large outbreak in\r\nUttar Pradesh took many lives, mostly of children.\r\nPresently, nearly 330 million people are considered to be at\r\nrisk. Although the disease has not been reported from\r\nnorthern states of the Punjab region, the presence of\r\nvectors, a reservoir and a susceptible population indicates\r\nthat the disease may occur in the near future.

Average nearest neighborhood\r\nanalysis indicated that the cases were more clustered in the postflood period as compared with the preflood period, with\r\nobserved mean distance of 1,139 meters and 1,666 meters, respectively (both at P < 0.01).

Independent factors associated with increased risk of diarrhea were households with water tank levels below 20% (odds ratio [OR] = 2.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.16-4.60) and decreased handwashing frequency (OR = 3.00 [1.48-6.08]). \"\r\n\r\n\"A\r\ntotal of 244 cases of diarrhea were identified in Tuvalu\r\nduring the outbreak period from August 29 to October 16,\r\n2011 (epidemiological weeks 35\u201341), which comprised 204 cases reported by the PSSS and 40 additional cases\r\nidentified by inpatient and outpatient chart review.

The total number\r\nof cases across the outbreaks during 2004\u20132006 is unknown,\r\nbut they constitute, by far, the largest chikungunya fever epidemic on record. In La Reunion alone, the World Health\r\nOrganization estimated that more than 200,000 people had\r\nbeen infected.2 Estimated infections in Comoros and Lamu\r\nwere 215,000 (63% of the population) and 13,500 (75% of the\r\npopulation), respectively, based on serological surveys\r\n(Breiman RF and others, unpublished data).\"\r\n\r\n\"Cases of non-malarial febrile illness at Lamu District Hospital increased sharply in June 2004; of 88 patients who presented with symptoms consistent with chikungunya fever in\r\nAugust, 56 (63%) tested positive for acute CHIKV infection\r\nby PCR or IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\r\n(ELISA; Bedno SA and others, unpublished data). Longitudinal NDVI measurements for Lamu showed that the drought\r\nconditions preceding the chikungunya fever outbreak were\r\nthe most severe since 1998 (Figure 1B).

Pummala virus (PUUV) is\r\none of the most prominent zoonotic viruses in this northern boreal forests with bank vole as\r\nits only competent host. Human\u2019s infection occurs by breathing the aerosolized viral\r\nparticles shed through saliva, urine and feces of the infected host. The infection causes\r\nNephropathia Epidemia, a milder form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The\r\ndisease has relatively low death rates but can cause lifelong symptoms in humans. Here I\r\nhave investigated the prevalence of PUUV in bank voles between spring and autumn of\r\n2007-2010 and again in 2015...My results suggest a staggering 78 and 73 percent infection\r\nprevalence in burned forest in 2007 and 2015 compared to respective 55 and 44 percent\r\ninfection prevalence in mature forest. This significant difference was reversed in 2010 with\r\nthe reference area having the highest infection prevalence (65 to 33 percent respectively).\r\nThe low species diversity, along with habitat loss due to direct effect of forest fire are\r\nsuggested to be the two major contributing factors that have led to the very high infection\r\nprevalence in forest fire area...the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) is a small rodent (family of Circetidae)\"","draft":"0","cc":"Fires","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Puulmala Virus Infection","pa":"Puumala sp.","ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Voles","ttss":"Myodes glareolu","ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Charlotte Smith","PDF":"nematollahi_mahani_seyed_alireza_160307_(1).pdf","authors":"S.

Studies in China suggested that bacillary dysentery could be sensitive to precipitation, ambient temperature and flood events (Gao et al., 2016). Using time series analysis, the researchers observed that the monthly incidence of dysentery was positively associated with temperature, precipitation\r\nand relative humidity, but negatively related to air pressure in Jinan (Eastern China), Shenzhen (South), Shenyang (Northeast) and Beijing (North) (Zhang et al., 2007; Li et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2008).

In 2010,\r\n7,855 diagnosed malaria cases and 34,082 suspected cases with 19 deaths were reported in 1191 counties of 239 Provinces\/Municipalities\/Autonomous Regions in China. The annual incidence was 0.66\/10,000 population [76]. Only sixteen percent of malaria cases were caused by Plasmodium falciparum [76] mostly occurring in Yunnan Province, which is located in southern China. Yunnan remains a hypo-endemic region with persistent cases of both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. To identify risk factors related to climate change and its role in malaria transmission, a series of studies were\r\nconducted in mainland China to investigate the relationships between meteorological variables and malaria [19-46]. Except for a single study that found no association, all studies showed correlations between climatic variables and malaria in different locations and study periods\r\nin China. The contradictory study likely resulted from a short (6-month) study period [36]. In Yunnan province, two studies were conducted in 2009 to clarify potential risk factors of malaria transmission [26,31]. Clements et al. (2009) demonstrated that for P. vivax the relative risk appeared to cycle every 3 to 4 years, whereas for P. falciparum the pattern was less regular [26]. Hui et al. (2009) found that the influence of meteorological\r\nvariables on P. vivax malaria was greater\r\nthan that of P. falciparum malaria, especially in cluster areas, indicating P. vivax malaria may be more climate sensitive [31]. Almost all of these analyses identified a positive association between temperature indices and malaria\r\ntransmission. Some studies also reported that temperature was the most important climatic determinant in the transmission of malaria. For example, a study conducted in Jinan, which is a temperate city in northern China, showed that a 1\u00b0C rise in maximum temperature may be related to a 7.7% to 12.7% increase in the number of malaria cases, while a 1\u00b0C rise in minimum temperature may result in approximately 11.8% to 12.7% increase in cases [22]. Zhou et al. (2010) revealed that temperature was a key meteorological factor correlated to malaria incidence, implying the potential role of global warming in malaria\r\nre-emergence in central China early in the 21th century, especially in Anhui, Henan and Hubei Provinces along the Huang-Huai River [21]. However, the association between temperature variables and malaria incidence may not be\r\nconstant year-round. Tian et al. (2008) emphasized the stronger effect of minimum temperature on malaria incidence in the cool months in the rain forest area of Mengla County, Yunnan province, indicating increased\r\nrisk of transmission as a result of warmer winters [27]. Although global warning could make more areas climatologically suitable for malarial transmission; because higher\r\ntemperature promotes mosquito development, virus replication and feeding frequency of mosquitoes, extreme high temperature can also restrict the growth of mosquitoes and reduce the spread of malaria. Typically, temperatures lower than 16\u00b0C or higher than 30\u00b0C have a negative impact on the development and activities of mosquitoes [30].","draft":"0","cc":"Warming","pg":"4\u2502Protozoa","ps":"Malaria","pa":"Plasmodium","ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Mosquito","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Trista McKenzie","PDF":"document1.pdf","authors":"L.

Potential time-dependent mechanisms explaining these interactions have been described by Levy et al.14 and Moors et al.190 The \u201cconcentration effect\u201d occurs when dry conditions allow for the accumulation of microorganisms in the environment. Precipitation can cause a short-term \u201crunoff effect,\u201d via flushing of pathogens into surface water, resuspension of pathogens in sediment, and sewage overflows. When this occurs over longer time periods, the \u201cdilution effect\u201d may act, with higher flows diluting microbial concentrations.

This was designed to look at the specificity of the diagnosis of scabies, age distribution, severity, duration of illness, secondary infection and other sociodemographic variables as preparation for mass drug administration (MDA). The HEWs screened 1,125,770 people in the 68 districts in Amhara Region and a total of 379,000 confirmed cases of scabies was identified. The prevalence in the different districts ranged from 2% to 67% and the median was 33.5% [interquartile range (IQR) 19\u207b48%]. 49% of cases were school-aged children. The detailed study of 474 individuals who were recorded as scabies cases revealed that the specificity of the diagnosis of scabies by the HEWs was 98.3%.

Results suggest that both moderate and severe floods\r\nwould cause more bacillary dysentery cases in the research region, which is consistent with the findings\r\nin developed and developing countries. For instance, a study in Texas, USA, found that people in\r\nflooded areas were more likely to suffer from diarrhea than those in non-flooded areas during the floods\r\nin 2001 (with odds ratio (OR) = 10.8, p < 0.01) [33]. Another study conducted in Germany also suggested\r\nthat contacting the floodwater was a major reason for diarrhea (with OR = 5.8, 95% CI = 1.3\u201325.1) [34].\r\nA survey on impacts of the tropical storm Alison discovered that diarrhea was significantly correlated\r\nwith people living in flooded areas (with OR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.4\u201328.0) [35]. As for Lewes of Southern\r\nEngland, a study showed that people in the flooded area were significantly correlated with increased\r\nincidences of gastroenteritis during the floods in 2001 (RR: 1.7, p < 0.05) [36]. Moreover, our results are\r\nalso consistent with some studies carried out in China. In Qingdao floods are positively associated\r\nwith bacillary dysentery incidences (with RR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.22\u20131.64) [37]. Another study showed\r\nthat the RRs of floods on bacillary dysentery were 11.47 (with 95% CI: 8.67\u201315.33), 2.75 (with 95% CI:\r\n1.36\u20134.85) and 1.35 (with 95% CI: 1.23\u20133.90) respectively in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Xinxiang in Henan Province [38]","draft":"0","cc":"Floods","pg":"1\u2502Bacteria","ps":"Dysentery","pa":"Shigella","ttg":"0\u2502Not specified","tts":"No-specified","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Trista McKenzie","PDF":"ijerph-14-00179.pdf","authors":"X.

In  addition,  infections  of Dirofilaria  immitisare  dramatically  increasing  and  extending  to previously unaffected areas such as Switzerland (Patz et al., 2008).The  changes  in  disease  incidence  are  attributed  to  effects  of  temperature  on  the  parasite  itself,  on  the density  of  the  vector  population  (and  the  emergence  of Ae.  albopictusas  a  competent  vector)  and  to changes  in  human  exposure.  Recent research  demonstrates  that temperature  dictates  the  development  of Dirofilarialarvae  in  the  vector,  with  a  threshold  below  which  development  will not  proceed  and consequently  determines  the  seasonal  occurrence  of  heartworm  transmission  in  temperate  latitudes.

Further, there have been observed changes in human disease. The incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Sweden approximately doubled for the period 1984- 1994, compared with 1960-1983.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an Alphavirus from the Togaviridae family that shares the\r\nsame vectors responsible for spreading dengue virus, namely Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent,\r\nAedes albopictus, which are the common peridomestic mosquito species in the Southeast Asia region.\r\nSince 2004, several million indigenous cases of Chikungunya virus disease occurred in Africa, the Indian\r\nOcean, India, Asia and, recently, Europe. The virus, usually transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,\r\nhas now repeatedly been associated with a new vector, Ae. Albopictus [10]. A notable recent example\r\nis the chikungunya virus epidemic that swept through the Indian Ocean region beginning in 2006 and\r\nwhich is believed to have infected >2 million persons. CHIKV infections occurred in Kuala Lumpur,\r\nMalaysia in 1998.

Avian influenza viruses occur naturally in wild birds without producing any illnesses,\r\nhowever, a highly pathogenic strain of the disease named H5N1 is currently a major concern because\r\nit can affect humans and cause high case fatality. The first clinical respiratory illness of H5N1 avian\r\ninfluenza occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when 18 human cases were reported during a poultry outbreak.\r\nIt broke the species barrier to infect humans, cats, and tigers. So far it has affected many countries in Asia,\r\nAfrica, and Europe. This emerging situation is mainly because severe winter conditions and droughts,\r\noccasioned by climate change can disrupt the normal migration pathways of wild birds and thereby bring\r\nboth wild and domestic bird populations into greater contact at remaining water sources. So climate\r\nchange influence the avian influenza virus transmission cycle and directly affect virus survival outside\r\nthe host [28]. Climate change can alter bird migration patterns, changes in populations of waterfowl\r\nspecies, influence avian influenza virus transmission cycle. The EU has already experienced during early\r\n2006 that very cold weather in some areas causing feed scarcity and unusual freezing of open waters\r\nforced wild waterfowl to change their flyways which has led to the introduction of highly pathogenic\r\navian influenza of the H5N1 subtype into the EU[29]. Continuous evolution of the H5N1 virus has been\r\nsuggested by changes in the internal gene constellation, expanded host range, increased pathogenicity,\r\nand greater environmental stability [30,31].","draft":"0","cc":"Drought","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Avian bird flu","pa":null,"ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Birds","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Trista McKenzie","PDF":"9Myaing.pdf","authors":"T.

From this, it was possible to postulate for the first time that outbreaks of Buruli ulcer can be triggered by combinations of rainfall patterns occurring on a long (i.e., several years) and short (i.e., seasonal) temporal scale, in addition to stochastic events driven by the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation that may disrupt or interact with these patterns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Buruli ulcer (BU) is an emerging human skin disease caused by the mycobacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. Related to high-profile infections tuberculosis and leprosy, prevalence has been increasing in certain developing parts of the world and in some areas, it is more common than its aforementioned relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"During the period 1969\u20132012, the series was dominated by four inter-annual peaks in rainfall followed by three inter-annual periods of recessions, with three corresponding peaks and recessions of BU disease cases. The results of the wavelet coherence analyses showed a statistically significant correlation between the two time series for 1979\u20132000, with cohering peaks and troughs over periods of approximately 8 years (Figure 6A). ...In essence, after a peak in rainfall, during a dry period, the number of BU cases increases.\"\r\n\r\n\"The majority of the BU cases\r\noccur when both the long- and short-term temporal changes coincide,\r\nsuggesting weather conducive to providing an increase in infectious\r\nhabitats or human contact with these habitats during such a period.\r\nUsing the argument that the disease agent is most abundant in stagnant water, it is possible to hypothesize that large bodies of water\r\ncreated after several years of high rainfall may recede slowly, stagnate\r\nand undergo significant changes in biotic community over several dry\r\nyears. Nested within this period, high peaks in rainy seasons as suggested by an increase in the biannual component, or SST-driven rainfall anomalies, will cause these stagnating areas to swell, potentially\r\nflooding or seeping onto pathways where human contact is increased.\"","draft":"0","cc":"Precipitation","pg":"1\u2502Bacteria","ps":"Buruli ulcer","pa":"Mycobacterium ulcerans","ttg":"2\u2502Water-borne","tts":"Contact","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Charlotte Smith","PDF":"emi201456a.pdf","authors":"Morris, A., Gozlan, R.E., Hassani, H., Andreou, D., Couppi\u00e9, P.

The relatively low mean temperatures revealed at Kericho over the last c.20 years are similar to those reported by Zhou et al.

(35) from a separate station at Kericho for the period 1966\u20131995. The malaria developmental period estimated from the Detinova curve (12) for the cool mean temperatures at Kericho is too long to allow malaria transmission in most years. However the regular malaria epidemics observed there since the 1980s can be explained by the observed diurnal temperature fluctuations; at these cooler altitudes, there is nonetheless sufficient heat during part of the day to allow EIP to be routinely completed within the lifespan of adult Anopheles mosquitoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We find that, in general, temperature fluctuation reduces the impact of increases in mean temperature. Diurnal temperature fluctuation around means >21\u00b0C slows parasite development compared with constant temperatures, whereas fluctuation around <21\u00b0C speeds development. Consequently, models which ignore diurnal variation overestimate malaria risk in warmer environments and underestimate risk in cooler environments. \"","draft":"0","cc":"Warming","pg":"4\u2502Protozoa","ps":"Malaria","pa":"Not Specified","ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Mosquito","ttss":"No-specified","ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Charlotte Smith","PDF":"13844_full.pdf","authors":"Paaijmans, Krijn P.; Read, Andrew F.; Thomas, Matthew B.","year":"2009","title":"Understanding the link between malaria risk and climate"},{"id":"2156","cc_id":"6","pg_id":"19","ps_id":"66","pa_id":"67","ttg_id":"43","tts_id":"66","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"\"In this study, we aimed to describe the evolution of three cholera epidemics that occurred in Lusaka, Zambia, between 2003 and 2006 and to analyse the association between the increase in number of cases and climatic factors...

While the association of DF epidemics to the ENSO was claimed for some South Pacific islands (Hales et al., 1996, 1999), this link could not be demonstrated for Thailand: the observed 3-year interannual periodicity of DHF incidence in Bangkok did not match with the 4-year periodicity of the MEI (Hay et al., 2000).","draft":"0","cc":"None","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Dengue","pa":null,"ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Mosquito","ttss":"Aedes albopictus","ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Camilo Mora","PDF":"NA","authors":"R.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an Alphavirus from the Togaviridae family that shares the\r\nsame vectors responsible for spreading dengue virus, namely Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent,\r\nAedes albopictus, which are the common peridomestic mosquito species in the Southeast Asia region.\r\nSince 2004, several million indigenous cases of Chikungunya virus disease occurred in Africa, the Indian\r\nOcean, India, Asia and, recently, Europe. The virus, usually transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,\r\nhas now repeatedly been associated with a new vector, Ae. Albopictus [10]. A notable recent example\r\nis the chikungunya virus epidemic that swept through the Indian Ocean region beginning in 2006 and\r\nwhich is believed to have infected >2 million persons. CHIKV infections occurred in Kuala Lumpur,\r\nMalaysia in 1998. The first sporadic outbreak of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection occurred between\r\nlate 1998 and early 1999 in Port Klang, Kuala Lumpur. CHIKV is endemic[(11] may play a substantial\r\nrole in the spread of the virus to humans, although the effect of a warmer climate has also been reported [12]. As a whole, such a climate abnormality of prolonged drier-than average conditions may be critical\r\nin introducing new viruses into the country [13].

It is complicated by hemorrhage, shock and sometimes death. Dengue viruses are\r\ntransmitted and replicates by mosquitoes. Dengue virus is belonged to the family Flaviviridae which in\r\naddition to dengue is comprised of yellow fever. Increased warming temperature at night is especially\r\nfavorable to Ae. aegypti while Ae. albopictus has been permitted to withstand at freezing condition.\r\nThe northern form of the mosquito is triggered by shortened periods of sunlight to enter diapauses, a\r\nphysiological state of the egg that makes the egg resist cold temperature and delays hatching until the\r\nspring. Thus, the mosquito is able to survive freezing. Dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Thailand in 1990\r\nnumbered more than 300,000 [16].

Following an abrupt onset involving fever, myalgia, and malaise, the patients\u2019 conditions deteriorated rapidly with the onset of pulmonary edema (CDC 1993). Death often occurred just hours after the onset of this crisis period (CDC 1993). It was remarkable that the etiologic agent had not been recognized previously, because it became apparent that the natural reservoir for [Sin Nombre virus] SNV was the widespread native deer mouse  and that SNV infection occurred throughout its range in the United States (CDC 2014). Additional cases of HPS occurring prior to 1993 have been retrospectively diagnosed (e.g., Zaki et al. 1996).\r\n\r\nThe HPS outbreak in 1993 followed an El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event the previous year (Parmenter et al. 1993, Yates et al. 2002), characterized by a large increase in regional precipitation in fall, winter, and spring.

Of the FLA, the\r\nNaegleria fowleri thrives in fresh waters like ponds, lakes, rivers and pools [1, 2]. This microbe acquires a cystic form (Fig. 1A-A2) in winters, to acquire a pathogenic form in heated summers with above-mentioned temperatures [1].

Vegetation and soil moisture are relevant factors in the transmission of Coxiella burnetii from infected farms to humans, by reducing the amount of dust available for dispersion of the bacteria.

Previously unknown in the region, more than 200 cases of C. gattii have now been documented in humans, and more than twice that number in domestic animals, accounting for an average annual incidence of 6.5 cases per million in BC or 27.9 cases per million on Vancouver Island; this is the highest \u201cendemic\u201d incidence reported worldwide [16]. There has been a substantial mortality from this disease; between 1999 and 2006, the case fatality rate from C. gattii disease was estimated to be 4.5% [17]...That C. gattii emerged as a human and animal pathogen in the late 1990s, in a new habitat, is indisputable. Whether or not the climatic conditions (both short- and long-term) in the new habitat made it conducive for the organism to do so is under debate. The oscillatory climate change patterns preceding the emergence were similar to the patterns seen in this area over the last 30 years. The years 1992\u20131994 and 1998\u20132003 were dryer than the 30-year average during the summer, followed by the years 1997, 2004, and 2005, which had higher-than-average summer rainfall; the winter rains roughly followed the same pattern. Importantly, however, the amount of snow coverage on southern Vancouver Island and the CDF biogeoclimatic zone decreased over the same time period. This constantly repeating dry\/wet pattern in conjunction with the elevation of temperature may well be a driving factor in the prolongation of C. gattii as a pathogen in this geographic location. However, given the paucity of long-term data on C. gattii emergence in relation to climate changes, it is difficult to attribute the emergence entirely to climate change.\"","draft":"0","cc":"Precipitation","pg":"3\u2502Fungus","ps":"Cryptococcosis","pa":"Cryptococcosis gatti","ttg":"0\u2502Not specified","tts":"No-specified","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Charlotte Smith","PDF":"176532.pdf","authors":"Datta, Kausik; Bartlett, Karen H.; Marr, Kieren A.","year":"2009","title":"Cryptococcus gattii: Emergence in Western North America: Exploitation of a Novel Ecological Niche"},{"id":"2584","cc_id":"3","pg_id":"62","ps_id":"541","pa_id":"542","ttg_id":"43","tts_id":"66","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"\"The relatively uncommon fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii recently emerged as a significant cause of cryptococcal disease in\r\nhuman and animals in the Pacific Northwest of North America.

Owing to shortages of food, deer mice invaded human settlements\r\nto forage, thus introducing the virus and causing the outbreak of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (Engelthaler et al., 1999). Severe drought can lead to a shortage of water supply, so residents use water from pools with no streamflow, secondary supplied water and water from long-term storage. Once the water resources are contaminated, outbreaks of intestinal infectious diseases can readily occur (Yang, 2007; Feng, 2000).

It also closely correlates with our isolations of Guanarito virus from wild rodents (Sigmodon alstoni and Zygodontomys brevicauda) collected during field studies in central Venezuela ([3] and unpublished data).... As shown in table 1, 53.3% of the 165 VHF cases occurred during the months of November, December, and January. This 3-month period corresponds with the end of the rains and the beginning of the dry season; it is a time of intense agricultural activity in the region, as crops are harvested and the land is cleared and tilled in preparation for the next planting. Consequently, there is probably more human contact with the soil and with potential rodent vectors during this period than at other times of the year.","draft":"0","cc":"Drought","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Venezuelan Hemorrhagic Fever","pa":"Guanarito virus","ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Rodents","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Kira Webster","PDF":"26-2-308.pdf","authors":"Manzione, Nuris de; Salas, Rosa Alba; Paredes, Hector; Godoy, Oswaldo; Rojas, Luis; Araoz, Francisco; Fulhorst, Charles F; Ksiazek, Thomas G; Mills, James N; Ellis, Barbara A","year":"1998","title":"Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever: clinical and epidemiological studies of 165 cases"},{"id":"2738","cc_id":"0","pg_id":"0","ps_id":"0","pa_id":"0","ttg_id":"0","tts_id":"0","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"","comments":"This paper was very short and did not describe environmental causes of this disease ","draft":"0","cc":"None","pg":null,"ps":null,"pa":null,"ttg":null,"tts":null,"ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Kira Webster","PDF":"30131725.pdf","authors":"Sexton, Daniel J; King, Geoff; Dwyer, Brian","year":"","title":"Fatal Queensland tick typhus."},{"id":"2739","cc_id":"0","pg_id":"0","ps_id":"0","pa_id":"0","ttg_id":"0","tts_id":"0","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"","comments":"","draft":"0","cc":"None","pg":null,"ps":null,"pa":null,"ttg":null,"tts":null,"ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"","authors":"Cua-Lim, FELICIDAD; LIM, MANUEL G","year":"1974","title":"Viral (Pneumonitis) Infections to Status Asthmaticus"},{"id":"2740","cc_id":"0","pg_id":"0","ps_id":"0","pa_id":"0","ttg_id":"0","tts_id":"0","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"","comments":"","draft":"0","cc":"None","pg":null,"ps":null,"pa":null,"ttg":null,"tts":null,"ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"redpath2013.pdf","authors":"Redpath, Steve M.; Young, Juliette; Evely, Anna; Adams, William M.; Sutherland, William J.; Whitehouse, Andrew; Amar, Arjun; Lambert, Robert A.; Linnell, John D.C.; Watt, Allan; Guti?rrez, R.J.","year":"2013","title":"Understanding and managing conservation conflicts"},{"id":"2741","cc_id":"6","pg_id":"19","ps_id":"978","pa_id":"0","ttg_id":"43","tts_id":"66","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"The incidence of cutaneous ulcers was observed after the rainy season in Djibouti in 1997.","draft":"0","cc":"Precipitation","pg":"1\u2502Bacteria","ps":"Cutaneous ulcers ","pa":null,"ttg":"0\u2502Not specified","tts":"No-specified","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"","authors":"Kerleguer, A; Koeck, JL; Girard-Pipau, F; Nicand, E","year":"2003","title":"Outbreak of tropical phagedenic ulcers after the rainy season in Dijibouti"},{"id":"2742","cc_id":"0","pg_id":"0","ps_id":"0","pa_id":"0","ttg_id":"0","tts_id":"0","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"","comments":"","draft":"0","cc":"None","pg":null,"ps":null,"pa":null,"ttg":null,"tts":null,"ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"kernif2012.pdf","authors":"Kernif, Tahar; Djerbouh, Amel; Mediannikov, Oleg; Ayach, Bouhous; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe; Bitam, Idir; Parola, Philippe; Socolovschi, Cristina; Jeanjean, Luc; Bitam, Idir; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Sotto, Albert; Labauge, Pierre; Raoult, Didier","year":"2012","title":"Rickettsia africae in Hyalomma dromedarii ticks from sub-Saharan Algeria; Warmer weather linked to tick attack and emergence of severe rickettsioses"},{"id":"2743","cc_id":"3","pg_id":"19","ps_id":"605","pa_id":"606","ttg_id":"29","tts_id":"30","ttss_id":"220","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"In Europe, most MSF cases occur in the summer.

Generalizing the climate variability observed in Portugal (formerly classified as a temperate Mediterranean type, with cold\r\nand heavily rainy winters) during the studied period, that is,warmer air temperature and lower precipitation in winters, one may suppose that even in natural environments R. sanguineus survival and broader activity periods are possible. Therefore, as mentioned, it is possible to have three generations in 1 year in the best environmental conditions. The autumn peak of nymphs observed in nature (and indirectly by the BF cases) is probably due to the newly emerged spring-fed larvae added to the nymphs or larvae of the previous year, inducing\r\na multiplying effect in the numbers of questing ticks. Also, the absence of heavy precipitation permits that eggs stay viable, without being washed by rain, and thus hatching occurs in higher numbers also. All data combined,\r\nthat is, isolation of rickettsiae from one blood sample and seroconversion in all cases presented here, resulted in an observed increase in \u201coff season\u201d BF

Clearly, transmission does not occur in climates where mosquitoes cannot survive. Warm, moist climates are most conducive\r\nto mosquito propagation and survival. The breeding habitat\r\nof the Anopheles vector is water. Anopheles mosquitoes are\r\nfound most commonly in deciduous and mixed forests as well as around human habitation (41). Mosquito larvae are found in small pools of water. Factors affecting larval breeding include quantity of food, density of larvae and salinity\r\nof the surrounding medium (42). The eggs are laid singly on the water surface film and can survive winter weather resiliently. The progression of aquatic stages of development\r\nof the Anopheline vector is accelerated under conditions of\r\nincreased temperature with optimal larval development at 28 C and optimal adult development between 28 C and 32 C (40). Malaria transmission cannot occur below 16 C or above 33 C as sporogony cannot occur. The ideal conditions for transmission are high humidity and environmental temperatures\r\nbetween 20 C and 30 C. Rates of transmission also depend on the number of times the infected mosquito bites the host and the duration of the mosquito lifespan, both of which are influenced by temperature (37). Thus, global\r\nwarming provides conditions conducive to the spread of malaria.","draft":"0","cc":"Warming","pg":"4\u2502Protozoa","ps":"Malaria","pa":null,"ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Mosquito","ttss":"Anopheles","ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"","authors":"Khasnis, Atul A; Nettleman, Mary D","year":"2005","title":"Global warming and infectious disease"},{"id":"2806","cc_id":"3","pg_id":"22","ps_id":"27","pa_id":"0","ttg_id":"29","tts_id":"32","ttss_id":"60","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"Dengue is an important mosquito-borne disease affecting humans and is transmitted by Aedes aegypti. This mosquito is well adapted to the urban environment and successfully\r\nbreeds in containers where water is allowed to accumulate,\r\nsuch as discarded cans, bottles, plastic containers and tires.\r\nAedes mosquitoes thrive in warmer environments but not in dry environments. Thus, the effect of global warming on diseases like dengue depends on both precipitation and temperature (53,54). Vezzani et al. (55) studied the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They noted highest abundances in breeding after several months with\r\nmean temperatures above 20 C and accumulated rainfalls above 150 mm. A sharp decline in egg laying was observed when monthly mean temperature declined to 16.5 C, and no eggs were found below 14.8 C. As with malaria, changes in the incidence of dengue appear strongly related to nonclimatological\r\nfactors. For example, there is a dramatic difference in the incidence of dengue along the Mexican-U.S.\r\nborder. States south of the border have a 500-fold increased\r\nincidence of disease compared with those just north of the border (48). Thus, climate appears to be only one factor in transmission of the disease.","draft":"0","cc":"Warming","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Dengue","pa":null,"ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Mosquito","ttss":"Aedes aegypti","ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"","authors":"Khasnis, Atul A;

Surface water turbidity\r\ncan also increase dramatically during heavy rainfall events\r\nand this can cause additional stress on inadequate water\r\ntreatment systems.","draft":"0","cc":"Precipitation","pg":"4\u2502Protozoa","ps":"Cryptosporidiosis ","pa":null,"ttg":"2\u2502Water-borne","tts":"Not- specified","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"water_vectorborne_diseases_and_CC2.pdf","authors":"Hunter, Paul R","year":"2003","title":"Climate change and waterborne and vector?borne disease"},{"id":"3218","cc_id":"7","pg_id":"33","ps_id":"508","pa_id":"658","ttg_id":"25","tts_id":"270","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"An additional outbreak was one of Acanthamoeba keratitis in\r\nIowa which followed flooding that inundated a water\r\ntreatment works (Meier et al. 1998).","draft":"0","cc":"Floods","pg":"4\u2502Protozoa","ps":"Acanthamebiasis","pa":"Acanthamoeba keratitis","ttg":"2\u2502Water-borne","tts":"Not- specified","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"water_vectorborne_diseases_and_CC2.pdf","authors":"Hunter, Paul R","year":"2003","title":"Climate change and waterborne and vector?borne disease"},{"id":"3219","cc_id":"7","pg_id":"19","ps_id":"37","pa_id":"0","ttg_id":"25","tts_id":"270","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"Outbreaks of leptospirosis in Rio de Janeiro\r\n(Barcellos and Sabroza 2001) and in the Philippines (Easton\r\n1999) have followed floods.","draft":"0","cc":"Floods","pg":"1\u2502Bacteria","ps":"Leptospirosis","pa":null,"ttg":"2\u2502Water-borne","tts":"Not- specified","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Isabella Gaw","PDF":"water_vectorborne_diseases_and_CC2.pdf","authors":"Hunter, Paul R","year":"2003","title":"Climate change and waterborne and vector?borne disease"},{"id":"3220","cc_id":"7","pg_id":"22","ps_id":"303","pa_id":"0","ttg_id":"25","tts_id":"270","ttss_id":"0","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"Hepatitis E, malaria and diarrhoeal disease have followed floods in Khartoom\r\n(Homeida et al. 1988;

By October, 1944, the level of the river was very low and the water restricted to pools. By December practically all sources of water away from the main river, such as waterholes, tributaries and marshes, had dried up and the river itself was a series of discontinuous restricted pools. So severe was the drought that game animals from eastern Acholi and Karamoja came in numbers down to the Aswa valley for water, appearing frequently among the farms and houses, where a great many\r\nwere killed. G. palpalis retreated also, from a normally extended distribution along the river and tributaries to the close neighbourhood of the remaining pools of water. These pools also became the venue for the local people from miles around, for water, washing, bathing and the watering of livestock. Thus an exceptionally close contact was established between man and tsetse, far closer and more prolonged than occurred in normal years.

Detectable transmission appeared to be confined to the period between the short and long rains (mid-December to mid-February.) A survival experiment with hookworm infective larvae supported the view that climatic conditions were unfavourable for transmission after the long rains. The pattern of egg counts in individual children differed. Of 20 children, 9 rose during the rains only to fall with their termination on a smooth curve. In 5, the egg count fell progressively during the study while in 3 others it fell only to rise again during the period of maximum transmission. In 3 children eggs were found only during this period. To explain these patterns a hypothetical curve considering primary infections, re-infections and postulating a threshold level to stimulate immunity is presented and discussed.

Counts remained fairly stable until March, 1965 but dropped slightly thereafter. Detectable transmission appeared to be confined to the period between the short and long rains (mid-December to mid-February.) A survival experiment with hookworm infective larvae supported the view that climatic conditions were unfavourable for transmission after the long rains. The pattern of egg counts in individual children differed. Of 20 children, 9 rose during the rains only to fall with their termination on a smooth curve. In 5, the egg count fell progressively during the study while in 3 others it fell only to rise again during the period of maximum transmission. In 3 children eggs were found only during this period. To explain these patterns a hypothetical curve considering primary infections, re-infections and postulating a threshold level to stimulate immunity is presented and discussed.\r\n[See also this Bulletin, 1967, v. 64, 647.] P.

Therefore global warming is likely to result in both an increased distribution of dengue to higher latitudes and altitudes as well as an increased incidence in endemic areas.","draft":"0","cc":"Warming","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Dengue","pa":"Dengue virus","ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Mosquito","ttss":"Aedes aegypti","ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Tabatha Knudson","PDF":"Environmental_change,_global_warming_and_infectious_diseases_in_Northern_Australia_Impact_of_global_warming_on_the_spread_of_infectious_diseases.pdf","authors":"Currie, Bart J; Wieliczko, A; Staroniewicz, Z","year":"2001","title":"Environmental change, global warming and infectious diseases in Northern Australia; Impact of global warming on the spread of infectious diseases"},{"id":"4015","cc_id":"7","pg_id":"22","ps_id":"276","pa_id":"819","ttg_id":"29","tts_id":"32","ttss_id":"94","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"The infrequent epidemics in temperate south-eastern Australia occur between January and May, usually following several seasons of high rainfall and flooding with large increases in vector populations (Mackenzie 1999; Spencer et al 2001)...MVE may be rare in Central Australia but after exceptionally heavy rainfall accompanied by flooding in early 2000 there was a cluster of cases confirmed in the region.","draft":"0","cc":"Floods","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Murray Valley Encephalitis","pa":"Flavivirus","ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Mosquito","ttss":"No-specified","ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Tabatha Knudson","PDF":"Environmental_change,_global_warming_and_infectious_diseases_in_Northern_Australia_Impact_of_global_warming_on_the_spread_of_infectious_diseases.pdf","authors":"Currie, Bart J; Wieliczko, A; Staroniewicz, Z","year":"2001","title":"Environmental change, global warming and infectious diseases in Northern Australia; Impact of global warming on the spread of infectious diseases"},{"id":"4016","cc_id":"7","pg_id":"22","ps_id":"132","pa_id":"820","ttg_id":"29","tts_id":"32","ttss_id":"137","ttsa_id":"0","ttsas_id":"0","impact":"Negative","comments":"There is also a relationship between JE [Japanese Encephalitis]\r\nand weather patterns.

Specifically, the migration of the mallard duck\u2014one of the primary reservoirs ofH1N1 avian influenza virus\u2014may have been disrupted by the anomaly described here, resulting inincreased presence of this species throughout Europe in the autumn of 1917 and 1918, in close proximityto both military and civilian populations, as well as domesticated animals (Oxford et al., 2005; Saunders\u2010Hastings & Krewski, 2016; Taubenberger et al., 1997; Worobey et al., 2014). Studies of disruptions in mallardmigration have shown that changes in the environment\u2014at start point and throughout the journey\u2014canaffect overall movement and direction (van Toor et al., 2013) interrupting their normal migratory route(Kleyheeg et al., 2019; Tolf et al., 2012). The transfer of H1N1 influenza virus from animals (avian and mam-mals) to humans (zoonosis) occurs primarily via water sources contaminated with fecal droppings frominfected birds (Breban et al., 2009; Carter & Sanford, 2012; Pawar et al., 2018; Vandegrift et al., 2010;Vittecoq et al., 2017; Worobey et al., 2014). In autumn, the rate of influenza A viral infection can be as highas 60% in mallard populations, due to the exposure of immunologically na\u00efve juveniles to the virus(Bengtsson et al., 2016; Tolf et al., 2012). Juveniles are especially prone to remain in the same area if theirmigration route is disrupted (van Toor et al., 2013). Exposure of mammalian hosts to the same infectedbodies of water where mallard ducks may have remained may explain connections to the current seasonalrecurrence of H1N1 in human populations as shown in recent studies (Belser & Terrence, 2019; Reidet al., 2004; Smith et al., 2009; Tang, 2009; Weingartl et al., 2009), suggesting that severe weather anomaliesin 1917\u20131919 may have contributed to both the diffusion and mutation of the Spanishflu virus, as previousstudies have suggested","draft":"0","cc":"Precipitation","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Influenza","pa":"H1N1","ttg":"2\u2502Water-borne","tts":"Contact","ttss":null,"ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Camilo Mora","PDF":"GH2-4-e2020GH000277.pdf","authors":"Alexander F.

Spring also coincides with the birth pulse and lactation for P. alecto, providing a potential additive source of physiological stress [17, 24, 48]. An alternative hypothesis to the effects of weather on food availability, and subsequent physiological stress, is that food shortages may aggregate animals around scarce resources, increasing contact and transmission among bats. Further empirical work is thus required to discern between the multiple mechanisms that relate weather with Hendra virus prevalence.","draft":"0","cc":"Drought","pg":"2\u2502Virus","ps":"Nipah Virus","pa":null,"ttg":"1\u2502Vector-borne","tts":"Bats","ttss":"Pteropus alecto","ttsa":null,"ttsas":null,"user":"Camilo Mora","PDF":"nihms933516.pdf","authors":"D.
